Setup and Installation
To run this project locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ignite-personal-brand-os

Firebase Configuration:
This application uses Firebase for authentication and data storage. You will need to set up a Firebase project and configure it.

Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/

Create a new project.

Add a web app to your project.

Copy your Firebase configuration object.

Note: In the Canvas environment, __app_id, __firebase_config, and __initial_auth_token are automatically provided. For local development, you would typically embed your Firebase config directly in the script or load it from an environment variable.

Replace the placeholder firebaseConfig and initialAuthToken variables in the <script type="module"> block with your actual Firebase config and consider how to handle authentication for local testing (e.g., enabling anonymous sign-in or email/password for testing).

Google Generative Language API Key:
The application uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash model for content generation.

Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio or the Google Cloud Console.

The apiKey variable in the fetch calls is left as an empty string (const apiKey = "";) because it's automatically provided by the Canvas environment. For local development, you would insert your actual API key here.

Open the index.html file:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. No complex build process is required as it's a pure HTML/CSS/JS application.
